👋 Hi, I’m @loaibaniez

👀 Data Visualization Specialist at the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, with hands-on experience maintaining, refreshing and enhancing reports and dashboards for real-world public sector use cases.

🛠️ My core stack: Power BI (including DAX, data modeling, Gateway & reports maintenance), Power Automate, Looker Studio, and Qualtrics. I work with PostgreSQL, SharePoint , and Google Sheets for data gathering and transformation — and I bring UX/UI thinking to the front end, designing dashboards that are not only accurate, but intuitive enough to move people to action. Currently sharpening my SQL and Python skills on DataCamp.

📖 Undergraduate Advanced Student of International Relations — which gives me a strong foundation for translating complex data into clear, decision-ready insights.

🌱 Currently driving end-to-end reporting improvements and looking to expand my knowledge in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

💞️ Looking for opportunities in Data Visualization where I can collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, tackle report inquiries creatively, and deliver results that matter.

🤍 I'm passionate about my work and solution-oriented: when a new issue comes up, I assess feasibility and propose creative, data-driven answers — which, funny enough, is exactly what a certain job description out there seems to be looking for. Last year, McKinsey's Forward Program sharpened that instinct, giving me a hypothesis-led approach to problem-solving and a a structured methodology to turn findings into clear, compelling communication.
